RAD Game Tools has been acquired by Epic.
There's been a discussion on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25675249) about it.

RAD is famous for their compression technology, so I thought I'd link two resources that I very much enjoyed watching or reading.

In HandmadeCon 2016, Jeff Roberts and Fabian Giesen of RAD game tools had 1.5 hour long interview with Casey Muratori about compression: [HandmadeCon 2016 - Compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj2xYRoz9ZI)

Oodle Kraken compression is implemented on the Playstation 5 hardware. This post by cbloom (also of RAD) goes into detail on how Kraken benefits the PS5, and explains the difference between Kraken and the well known Zip compression: [How Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture supercharge the IO system of the Sony PS5](http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/2020/09/how-oodle-kraken-and-oodle-texture.html)
