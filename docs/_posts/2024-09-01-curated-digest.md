Here's a listing of interesting material I consumed recently:

- **Why do tree-based models still outperform deep learning on tabular data?** ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08815))
- **Founder Mode**, an essay by paul Graham. Founders manage their companies differently, even when the companies scale. They do skip-levels, classic managers do not. ([Graham's blog](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html))
- **"Design in Practice"**, a talk by Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure. A beautiful talk with tips on how to approach the 'design phase' of a software project in a corporate environment. Design should be taken broadly here. In other circles this phase is often called 'discovery'. ([ClojureTV Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5QF2HjHLSE))


# Darknet Diaries Podcast

Podcast bout security, scams, and hackers, the dark side of the internet.

- **[EP 143: JIM HATES SCAMS](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/143/):** This episode features scambaiter [Jim Browning](https://www.youtube.com/@JimBrowning/).

- **[EP 134: DEVIANT](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/134/):** My favorite episode with Deviant Ollam. I was well aware of penetration testers, but I had no idea that physical penetration testers exist. This episode is full of fun stories about breaking into buildings, sneaking into secure compounds, and hiding in elevators. See also [Deviant's talk about elevator hacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHf1vD5_b5I).
